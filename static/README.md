# Upfactor

> My supreme Nuxt.js project (lol) 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

# Hey there! Please use "docker-compose up". If it doesn't work you could use 
 * _ docker build -t “upfactor” .
 * _ docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000/tcp upfactor

### So..
 - Juste made a page and build a small evolutive structure to complete a vue using a static json file.
 - Made class available to show possibility to create a real templating system.
